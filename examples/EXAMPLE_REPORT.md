## Security & Compliance

**Security Score:** 67/100 - ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS ATTENTION

### NSG Issues (6)

#### üî¥ Critical - Allow SSH from Internet

**Resource:** nsg-subnet-web

**Impact:** VMs in subnet-web are exposed to brute-force SSH attacks from the internet

**Remediation:** Remove rule allowing SSH (port 22) from 0.0.0.0/0. Implement Azure Bastion for secure administrative access.

---

#### üî¥ Critical - Allow RDP from Internet

**Resource:** nsg-subnet-app

**Impact:** Windows VMs exposed to remote desktop attacks from any IP address

**Remediation:** Remove rule allowing RDP (port 3389) from 0.0.0.0/0. Use Just-In-Time VM Access or Azure Bastion.

---

#### üü† High - Overly Permissive HTTPS Rule

**Resource:** nsg-subnet-web

**Impact:** HTTPS allowed from all sources without WAF protection

**Remediation:** Consider implementing Application Gateway with WAF for web traffic inspection

---

### Public Exposure Issues (2)

#### üü† High - VMs with Direct Public IP

**Resources:** vm-web-1, vm-jumpbox

**Impact:** Direct internet exposure increases attack surface

**Remediation:** Remove public IPs and implement Azure Bastion ($140/month) for all administrative access

---

### Encryption Issues (1)

#### üü° Medium - Storage Account Using HTTP

**Resource:** stproddata001

**Impact:** Data in transit not encrypted when accessed via HTTP

**Remediation:** Enable "Secure transfer required" setting to enforce HTTPS-only access

---

### ü§ñ AI-Powered Security Insights

*Generated using advanced AI analysis of your security posture*

#### üî¥ Priority 1: Implement Zero-Trust Network Architecture

**Category:** Network Security | **Severity:** Critical

**Description:** Current architecture relies on perimeter-based security with multiple NSG rules allowing broad internet access. This violates modern zero-trust principles and creates significant attack surface. The presence of public IPs on VMs, combined with permissive NSG rules, creates multiple entry points for attackers.

**Risk Level:** High probability of unauthorized access attempts. Brute-force attacks against SSH/RDP are common and can succeed with weak credentials or unpatched systems.

**Impact:** Potential unauthorized access, data breach, lateral movement within the network, compliance violations (SOC 2, ISO 27001, PCI-DSS)

**Recommendations:**
- Implement Azure Bastion ($140/mo) to eliminate all VM public IPs
- Remove all NSG rules with source 0.0.0.0/0 for management ports
- Enable Just-In-Time (JIT) VM Access in Microsoft Defender for Cloud
- Implement Azure Firewall for centralized ingress/egress control
- Enable NSG Flow Logs for traffic analysis and threat detection
- Consider Azure Front Door with WAF for web application protection

---

#### üü† Priority 2: Enable Comprehensive Security Monitoring

**Category:** Monitoring & Detection | **Severity:** High

**Description:** Limited diagnostic settings and monitoring coverage reduces visibility into security events. Without comprehensive logging, detecting and responding to security incidents is significantly delayed.

**Risk Level:** Security incidents may go undetected for extended periods

**Impact:** Delayed incident response, compliance violations, inability to conduct forensic analysis

**Recommendations:**
- Enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud (Standard tier) for advanced threat detection
- Configure diagnostic settings for all NSGs to send flow logs to Log Analytics
- Enable Azure Monitor for VMs to track security events
- Implement Azure Sentinel for SIEM capabilities and automated response
- Create alert rules for suspicious activities (failed logins, privilege escalation)
